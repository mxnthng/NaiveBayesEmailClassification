don ' t wait for customized drugs , which are years away . buy shares in a company using dna for diagnostic work .  forbes - good genes , kerry a . dolan , may 16 , 2005  new patented tests created with information gleaned from genome mapping have injected new life and higher margins ( near 75 % ) into the business . the $ 2 . 5 billion molecular diagnostics industry is expanding at a 15 % annual rate , according to consulting firm leomics associates of emerson , n . j .  genethera ( gtha ) : making their mark in biotech  genethera has just recently teamed up with biotech giant beckman coulter inc .  they are the first to market with a blood test for mad cow disease on live cattle  they have the ability to detect numerous infectious diseases utilizing genetic methods from the blood of a live animal  they are the first to market with a blood test for detecting cwd  they are presently developing a therapeutic vaccine for cwd and mad cow disease using rna interference technology  they are currently developing a blood test using the same platform for breast and prostate cancer detection with their strategic partner xpng ( xpention genetics inc . )  genethera could end beef recalls ' and potentially the slaughter of millions of animals around the globe while saving the industry hundreds of millions of dollars each year  currently funded by an institutional money manager in southern california , genethera has plans to open laboratories worldwide to handle this growing bse testing demand .  genethera could generate revenues over $ 13 million for every 1 % of cattle tested in the usa alone  international testing figures would be staggering .  genethera technology :  genethera ' s business is based on its integrated technology platform ( itp ) that combines a proprietary diagnostic solution called gene expression assay ( gea ( tm ) ) with purivax ( tm ) , its system for analyzing large - scale dna sequencing .  the first part of this platform is the ongoing development of molecular diagnostic assays solutions using real time fluorogenic polymerase chain reaction ( f - pcr ) technology to detect the presence of infectious disease from the blood of live animals . the second part of the itp is the development of therapeutic vaccines using rna interference technology . it also allows for the efficient , effective , and continuous testing , management and treatment of animal populations . these facts distinguish the technology from any alternative testing and management methodology available to agriculture today - - all of which require the destruction of individual animals and even entire herds . our testing and data analysis processes also allow us not only to separate infected from clean animals , but also to gain knowledge vital to development of preventative vaccines .  genethera inc . is committed to providing global access to cutting edge biotechnology services to fellow scientists in academia , the pharmaceutical industry , and the biotechnology industry . primarily , genethera ' s expertise focuses on technology relevant to animal and human immunotherapy . genethera is dedicated to furnishing dependable , high quality , cost - effective and prompt client consulting services . these services are backed by the cumulative experiences of greater than 100 years of research and development in both government and industry by genethera ' s senior scientists . genethera develops a commercial - scale implementation of adenovector purification process to support rd material production . furthermore , genethera evaluates and tests commercially available expression vectors and incorporates them into its vector repertoire . these technologies are well established within the repertoire of genethera ' s scientific staff .  genethera can uniquely detect and treat a variety of diseases in animals while they are still alive .  the company provides genetics - based diagnostic and vaccine solutions to meet the growing demands of today ' s veterinary industry and tomorrow ' s agriculture and healthcare industries . the company is organized and operated both to continually apply its scientific research to more effective management of diseases and , in so doing , realize the commercial potential of molecular biotechnology .  the core of genethera ' s operation is the ongoing development of molecular diagnostic assays using real time fluorogenic polymerase chain reaction . ( f - pcr ) technology uses live animal blood to detect the presence of infectious diseases and for the development of vaccines for such blood born diseases . it also allows for the efficient , effective , and continuous testing , management and treatment of animal populations . these facts distinguish the technology from any alternative testing and management methodology available to agriculture today - - all of which require the destruction of individual animals and even entire herds . our testing and data analysis processes also allow us not only to separate infected from clean animals , but also to gain knowledge vital to development of preventative vaccines .  to date , genethera has successfully developed the assay ability to detect mad cow and chronic wasting disease , a disease affecting elk and deer in north america . diagnostic assays for e . coli ol 57 : h 7 and johnne ' s disease are in the final stages of development . vaccines for e . coli ol 57 : h 7 and johnne ' s disease , both of which are diseases affecting cattle , are in advanced stages of development . in the future , the company plans to expand assay application research to a wide range of diseases / animals , the immediate targets being mad cow , hoof mouth , west nile and newcastle .  genethera can detect bse using the companies patented live animal blood test that evaluates the e . d . r . f . gene sequence . the e . d . r . f . gene is proven to decrease dramatically before any tse infection is noticeable in a live animal or human . the patent gtha holds is broad based and can detect all tse diseases including mad cow ( bse ) in cattle , cwd in elk deer and creutzfeld - jacobs in humans  the company ' s patented test can detect these diseases faster than any other method developed in the marketplace and at far less a cost . the test can also be used on a mass scale using roche f - pcr , dna analyzing robotics equipment . genethera can analyze over 2000 blood samples a day with one f - pcr machine and a single technician . the project will prove highly profitable at approx $ 4 . 00 per test when wide scale commercialization is under way .  a multi - billion dollar , international demand for commercial mad cow testing has emerged around the globe .  japan conducted 3 million post - mortem rapid mad cow tests last year alone . they used the western blot developed by prionics ag in swizterland and bio - rad ' s rapid test . costs are between $ 20 and $ 40 dollars per test . most importantly , other tests in the marketplace cannot detect the disease until the animal has been killed . testing through post - mortem brain tissue exams is extremely labor intensive and costly .  japan spent between $ 60 million - $ 120 million on 3 million post mortem rapid mad cow tests in 2004 .  genethera ' s simple blood test can be collected using their patented field collection system . the sample is then mailed to the lab for testing . the company also stated in their recent 10 k that they are currently in negotiations with strategic testing partners that we believe will absorb the costs of commercializing our live animal mad cow test .  management :  dr . tony milici -

"Subject: partnership  mr . edward moko  18 independence close ,  johannesburg ,  south africa .  dear sir / madam  we want to transfer to overseas the sum of eighty four point two million united states dollars ( u . s . $ 84 . 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) from a bank in africa .  i want to ask you to kindly look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new bank account immediately to receive this money , though an empty bank account could serve this purpose as long as you will remain honest to me till the end of this important business trusting in you and believing in god that you will never let me down either now or in time to come .  i am mr . edward moko . the external auditor of a bank . during the course of our auditing , i discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the bank in 1998 and since 2001 nobody has operated on this account gain . after going through some old files in the records , i discovered that the owner of the account died without a "" heir apparent to the throne "" hence the money is floating and if i do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing . the owner of this account who is mr . eshed . b . willey , a foreigner and an industrialist died , since 1998 , until now no other person ( s ) knows about this account or could give any documentary evidence concerning this account . as such this account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that eshed . b . willey until his death was the manager oriental diamond company , in south africa . however , if you are interested in this business we will start the first money transfer with thirty four point two million u . s . dollars ( u . s . $ 34 . 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) upon successful transaction without any disappointment from you . we shall also re - apply for the payment of the remaining amount to your account . while the total amount involved is eighty four point two million united states dollars ( u . s . $ 84 . 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) only . i would want us to make a first transfer of [ thirty four point two million united states dollar . u . s . $ 34 . 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before the rest . i am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local account , without valid international foreign "" agreement "" , but could only be approved to any foreigner with valid international credentials : passport or drivers license and foreign account because this sum is in u . s . dollars and the former owner of the account mr . eshed . b . willey is a foreigner too , thus the money could only be approved into a foreign account . however , knowing all this , we will reach a binding agreement in this regards .  as a matter of urgency , i will inform you the next step to take , while you send your private telephone and fax number including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit . i want us to meet face to face to build confidence and to sign a binding agreement that will bind us together before transferring the money to any account of your choice where the fund will be safe . before we fly to your country for withdrawal , sharing and investments , i need your full co - operation to make this business a success , because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account , which i will give to you , upon your positive response and once i am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with the instructions of a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in this business . i need your strong assurance that you will never let me down . with my influence and the position in the bank we can transfer this money to any foreigner ' s reliable account which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing . and to build confidence that you can come immediately to discuss with me face to face after which i will make this remittance in your presence and three of us will fly to your country at least two days ahead of the money going into the account . i will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately i hear from you that you are ready to act as directed . to prove the authenticity of the business i will use my position and influence to obtain all legal approvals for onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance from the relevant ministries , foreign exchange departments , embassy and board of internal revenue services . at the conclusion of this business , you will be given 35 % of the total amount , 60 % will be for me , while 5 % will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during this process .  i look forward to your earliest reply through my email address .  respectfully  mr . edward moko .",1

"" breakthrough "" products in the vspc pipeline  vpsc products in the process of commercialization are expected to enable up to 10 hours of laptop computer usage , and three weeks of cell phone operation using fuel cells , gps - free navigation , especially for places where gps doesn ' t work ( a top dod priority ) , automated analysis of air and seaport cargo containers based on x - ray imaging ( homeland security ) , identification of narcotics , chemicals , and biological weapons .  another total breakthrough , with a nanotechnology based mass spectrometer is a portable , carry - on suitcase size device that processes identifies one molecule at a time : further miniaturization is expected to shoebox size , compared with stationary desk size provided by today ' s competitors .  significant recurring income from fuel cell batteries  in five years , annual revenue from disposable fuel cartridges for fuel cell - powered portable electronic devices is expected to range between $ 7 billion on the low side to $ 45 billion on the high side . that market does not exist today .  vspc ' s fuel cell cartridge business model is similar to the well - known razor / razor blade model , which is to sell the razor and then make much more money on the recurring blade business . the fuel cell is a razor , and the disposable fuel cartridge is the razor blade .  another analogy is the  flashlight / battery model . imagine if a company had the primary intellectual property involved in manufacturing flashlights . it would probably license that technology to major flashlight manufacturers , in return for help in dominating the recurring flashlight battery business .  in this case vspc has the proprietary rights to the ' flashlight ' - - the fuel cell - - and intends to sell the "" flashlight battery "" - - specifically , disposable fuel cartridges , for an end - user price of $ 2 - $ 3 each .  vspc is currently negotiating to provide its patented fuel cell technology to major computer manufacturers , in return for their agreement to use disposable fuel cartridges developed by vspc , the manufacturing of which will be outsourced to well - known , major plants in the far east .  intellectual property protected with patents  vspc ' s fuel cell technology , for example , is protected by over 70 issued and pending patents .  strategic partners lend credibility  to create a cost - effective worldwide footprint , emerging companies must partner with branded , global companies who have strong management teams and significant resources .  vspc is partnering with major , well - known market leaders who have management , resources and global branding . partners are attracted to vspc ' s technology , and expect to gain competitive advantage by integrating patented , proprietary technology obtained from vspc .  for example , in the fuel cell business , toshiba , nec , sanyo , hitachi and samsung have unveiled prototype fuel cell powered products that more than double the operating time over existing battery technology . these companies are potential strategic partners for vspc . to better work with japanese manufacturers , vspc has opened a tokyo office .  "" fabless "" business model enables cost - effective growth  fabless semiconductor chip companies design and develop proprietary chips , then outsource manufacturing to wafer plants in the far east . some well - known fabless semiconductor companies , ranked by market capitalization , include  $ 12 billion market cap , broadcom ( brcm )  press here to view  $ 11 billion market cap , marvell semiconductor ( mrvl )  press here to view  $ 9 billion market cap , xilinx ( xlnx )  press here to view  $ 7 . 3 billion market cap , altera ( altr )  press here to view  $ 4 . 5 billion market cap , nvidia corp ( nvda )  press here to view  $ 4 . 4 billion market cap , sandisk corp ( sndk )  press here to view  $ 3 billion market cap , ati technologies ( atyt )  press here to view  ( other technologies products to be discussed in future analyst report updates )  vspc expects to use emerging computational , rf , imaging and nanosensor technologies to drive market growth by enabling gps -

"Subject: industry giants can ' t match this opportunity  another ground breaking news alert from rlyc .  the potential stored - value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people , of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored - value debit card accounts .  one company is quickly entering a $ 2 trillion market space with a proposed portfolio of product and service offerings that even the largest multi - national corporations in its industry may have a hard time matching . in just a few months , this company has begun adding and developing innovative new products and targeting acquisitions that could help it reach millions of new long - term customers that could generate tremendous re - occurring revenues for many years to come .  although you have probably never heard of this company , you may soon hear of it even if you don ' t continue reading this message . that ' s because it is making a major push to put its products in the hands of a half million people in the u . s . within the next year .  an upstart company to make a real impact in a two trillion dollar industry  in reality , this company ' s lack of early recognition could be a major plus for you . since the overwhelming majority of investors and institutions don ' t know this company or what they plan to accomplish , their stock is trading at rock bottom prices . but , if they do accomplish even a small part of what they have set out to do over the coming months and years , this company could become a significant player in its trillion dollar industry and its stock reflect its accomplishments .  the company that we ' ll introduce you to today is ( relay capital corp . pink sheets : rlyc ) . rlyc , which recently went public , is a multi - faceted financial services company that focuses primarily on the stored value card market . rlyc ' s present product and service offerings include pre - paid stored - value cards , reward cards , employee payroll cards , gift , retail and affinity group cards , travel cards and funds transfer cards . these services are aimed at a significant market both domestically and internationally .  just because a company is in a large and growing industry doesn ' t necessarily ensure that it will be a winner . in order to be successful , that company also needs to be truly innovative , have very strong partners , be able to reach vast customer bases and have a management team capable of putting it all together and turning its goals into reality . rlyc appears to be that company .  below we ' ll discuss this substantial potential market rlyc is after and what sets rlyc apart from the competition .  the potential stored - value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people , of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored - value debit card accounts .  stored - value cards have the potential to help the 50 million adults and their families who have been excluded from the e - commerce revolution because they do not have access to credit or banking facilities . the implications reverberate across industry segments . estimates suggest stored - value transactions could exceed $ 2 trillion in just a few years .  rlyc ' s focus is on providing stored - value cards to the un - banked and under - banked . these terms refer to consumers that that do not have a bank account , debit card . the size of that group is staggering that ' s about one - third of the nation ' s work force !  rlyc capitalizes on the dilemma these consumers face by providing stored - value card programs that make it easy , fast and secure for people and businesses to buy all manners of goods and services using stored - value cards as well as for the un - banked and under - banked to be paid their salaries via the same cards .  but that ' s not all . the benefits relay will offer on its stored value cards as well as other financial services will also be of great benefit to those who already have banking relationships . in this segment , relay plans to offer more services with greater convenience for less cost to the consumer . who wouldn ' t want that ? the payroll market is another enormous market for rlyc  for the under - and un - banked , collecting their pay , cashing payroll checks and then paying bills with those funds can be extremely complicated and time consuming . rlyc ' s stored - value pay transfer card program presents a very effective and innovative solution for this problem .  rlyc ' s pay transfer card program can lower costs to employers to process payroll for the banked and the un - banked alike ! lower costs to cardholders to potentially transfer cash between u . s . cards , cards in foreign countries , and services bought through the cards , improved employee retention , improved customer retention will all be available thanks to rlyc . various programs will make life much easier for cardholders using the system , while also providing the convenience and flexibility of either visa or mastercard purchasing power or 24 hour access to their money through atms .  rlyc signs loi with national staffing company to use its pay transfer cards  earlier this year , rlyc signed a binding letter of intent to provide a pay transfer card program for asgard global resources llc ( click to go to their site ) , a leader in providing technical , craft and administrative staffing services to businesses , industry and government through locations in houston , dallas , long island , orlando , phoenix and southern california all areas with huge un - and under - banked populations .  the potential market for this service is really big . it includes large employers , companies that process payroll and financial institutions that provide banking and payroll services to commercial customers .  this system will simplify payments to widely dispersed employees and contractors while dramatically decreasing payroll distribution by offering a cost effective alternative to printing , cutting , and mailing paper payroll checks . it also helps to reduce a great deal of paper processing of checks and pay , eliminate lost checks , stop payments and minimize fraud . but best of all , this should help to significantly boost rlyc ' s revenues .  $ 150 billion sent worldwide by relatives to home countries  mexicans in u . s . send $ 16 . 3 billion a year back to mexico  with $ 150 billion being transferred internationally each year , remittances are a really big business . in times past , people wanting to send money to relatives back in their home countries had few choices . many times their only choice was an expensive proposition like western union . more recently , more and more people have resorted to purchasing and mailing money orders in order to try to cut down on the cost of sending remittances .  the problems with traditional money transfer methods  with wire services , there are any number of inherent problems when trying to send money to relatives overseas . first , wiring funds across borders can be expensive . this can make it very cost - prohibitive to send smaller amounts of cash and often means that relatives must wait longer to receive their remittances because the sender has to save up until the amount is large enough to warrant the cost associated with the wire service . next there is the problem of logistics . both the sender and the recipient must be able to easily reach a storefront that offers the same wire company ' s services . even if they both are able to do this , the recipient may have to make multiple trips to the wire service office to check to see if their funds have cleared yet and can be released to them . lastly , the sender and the recipient are subjected to varying service fees depending on which wire service they choose . these fees can be very high and can significantly cut into the amount of money the recipient ultimately receives . so , even though using a wire service may be a fairly fast way to transfer money , it can be very expensive and logistically difficult to use .  with money orders there is always the problem of mail service . although in america we have grown accustomed to relatively quick and reliable mail service , this is not always the case in foreign countries . this is especially true in underdeveloped nations , where most remittances are sent . a letter containing a remittance that a family is depending on to provide much needed food and shelter could take many days or even weeks to arrive . and , there is always the chance that it will never arrive at its destination at all , meaning that the sender ' s family could go hungry or end up on the streets .  what is the best way to send remittances ?  by far the most convenient , fast , safe and ultimately cost efficient method to send remittances is through a stored - value card . with this type of service , a person can easily activate a card and then just deposit funds into the account ( onto the card ) via loading station , telephone or the internet for easy use by relatives in his or her home country .  the process is extremely easy and cost - effective . funds can be added to the card ' s account at an ever increasing number of convenient locations . the family member overseas can then draw down on those funds by presenting a card from that account to make purchases or they can use the card to withdraw cash from atms . it could not be any simpler .  rlyc has already begun filling orders  in june of this year , rlyc announced that it had received its first order for 2 , 000 pin - based stored value cards . the company stated that its growth estimates call for approximately 2 , 000 new stored - value cards being put into circulation each month . this could result in exponential revenue growth as new customers are added and its customers take advantage of its other financial services . moreover , though other programs it is working on , it could have one half million cards in the market within the next 18 months .  rlyc plans to expand its services through partner companies and one - stop financial centers  rlyc expects to fuel exponential growth of recurring revenue from individual card usage , monthly fees , as well as other activities occurring at its loading centers or the virtual financial centers it is planning . loading centers are retail locations , such as convenience stores , check cashing facilities or other types of retail facilities serving to dispense or receive cash facilitating transactions for the debit card consumer . rlyc has already established strategic relationships with leading card processors , vendors and distributors , and is in program development with key partners that may bring over 100 , 000 retail locations and a host of great opportunities to dramatically increase its brand recognition .  rlyc plans a host of new financial products and service offerings  some of the products and services rlyc plans to be launching in the coming months include commercial , auto and sba loans , mortgages , all types of affinity group ( loyalty / rewards ) cards , pharmacy discount cards , certificates of deposit ( cd ' s ) , health savings accounts and health and life insurance . rylc is expanding extremely rapidly and at this pace , should gain a whole lot of exposure to the investment community f - a - s - t ! ! !  rlyc plans to grow through joint ventures and acquisitions  through a well - planned strategy to partner with major players in the financial services industry and through key acquisitions of complimentary companies , rlyc plans to fuel its growth . it has begun identifying and will negotiate business joint ventures , acquisitions and partnerships within the stored value card industry .  rlyc is positioned to offer expanded payroll products as well as define a niche market for its private label stored value solutions . with corporate network ' s assistance , it expects to add new and expansive products linked to its card platform and provide its customers with a growing range of superior products and increased customer loyalty .  rlyc plans to enter the emerging high growth health savings account ( hsa ) market  rlyc has entered into an agreement in principle with mydaily corp . , an employee benefit and financial services company , to provide health saving account ( hsa ) stored value debit cards that will enable employees to easily pay routine medical bills with pre - tax dollars .  health savings accounts ( hsa ) are tax - sheltered savings accounts similar to an ira , but earmarked for medical expenses and are part of a high deductible insurance plan . deposits are 100 % tax - deductible for the self - employed and for employees of companies that offer an hsa .  this could be an enormous new market for rlyc  it is estimated that all millions of non - elderly americans will soon have access to a health savings account , creating a market of unprecedented potential . in fact , due to the rising costs of employer - sponsored health plans , it is also estimated that one in every two major employers in the united states is considering consumer directed health plans and hsa for their employees .  experienced stored value card and financial services industry executive named ceo of relay capital corp .  e . reese bogle iii , experienced financial services and stored value card industry executive , has been named relay ' s . most recently he was one of the founders , and served as executive vice president and chief operating officer of interstate net bank ( www . isnbank . com ) , establishing it as a visa principal member .  prior to this , mr . bogle , was vp of e * trade bank ' s corporate development and strategic alliances group and president of telebanc insurance services , inc . he also served as vp and marketing director of premium bank , and held a variety of managerial and marketing positions at leading financial services companies .  relay will be adding real depth experience to its management team  the next step is to bring a well qualified management team to relay capital said mr . bogle . once the team is onboard , we intend to build relay capital into a diversified financial services provider that , in addition to looking for exponential growth of recurring revenue generated from individual stored card usage , as well as other financial service activities occurring at our card loading centers or its virtual financial centers , we potentially plan to provide : commercial loans , auto loans , sba loans , mortgages , certificates of deposit ( cd ' s ) , health benefits ( dental , vision ) , life insurance benefits , pharmacy drug discounts , loyalty and reward programs , and shopping discount programs .  with innovative products and services targeted to trillion dollar market ; a host of powerful partners ; key acquisitions in the works ; orders already coming in ; and a top - notch management team to bring it all together , rlyc seems to be headed for sunny skies .  this company will not remain below the radar screens of wall street ' s mover shakers or even the average investor for much longer . . . if you are on the lookout for companies that have what it takes to experience rapid growth , but are still trading at rock bottom prices , you should call your financial advisor today about relay capital corp .

"Subject: please kindly assist  greetings ,  i am prince fayad w . bolkiah , the eldest son of prince jefri bolkiah , former finance minister of brunei , the tiny oil - rich sultanate on the northern coast of the island of borneo , in eastern asia . i will save your time by not amplifying my extended royal family history , which has already been disseminated by the international media during the controversial dispute that erupted between my father and his step brother , the sultan of brunei sheik muda hassanal bolkiah .  as you may know from the international media , the sultan had accused my father of financial mismanagement and impropriety of us $ 14 . 8 billion dollars . this was as a result of the asian financial crisis that made my father company amedeo development company and government owned brunei investment company to be declared bankrupt during his tenure in office . however my father was kept under house arrest , his bank accounts and private properties including a crude oil export refinery were later confiscated by the sultanate .  furthermore , during this unfortunate period i was advised to evacuate my immediate family outside the sultanate to avoid further prosecution from the sultan and his security operatives , but before i could do that i was placed under house arrest by the sultan and i have no access to a phone but i have a palm v hand - held computer from which i am sending you this mail . before my incaceration , i went ahead to dispatch the sum of fifty eight million five hundred thousand united states dollars us $ 58 . 5 million in cash under special arrangement into the custody of a private security and trustee company for safe keeping abroad .  hence i seek your good assistance to invest these funds into profitable investment in your country to facilitate future survival for my family abroad . i have decided to offer 10 % of these funds to you as compensation for your strong cooperation .  please i count on your absolute confidentiality , transparency and trust while looking forward to your prompt reply towards a swift conclusion of this business transaction .  i remain yours sincerely .  prince fayad . w . bolkiah  brunei darussalam .",1

( gtts ) be the next stock to rock ?  recently ,  we read an article in the economist that highlighted online gaming and  how it has become a socially acceptable form of entertainment . over the  next few days , as we thought about what sort of impact this trend could  have , we started to notice that online gambling was being discussed all  over the media - in newspapers , online and on television . it became  obvious to us that more and more people were jumping on the internet to  bet on games . we also came across some staggering statistics .  merrill lynch , for example , has predicted that gambling has the  potential to account for a full 1 % of global economic activity ! another  source , ecommercetimes . com , recently reported that the scope of this  business is so enormous that some have even claimed that it is the  single most important factor in the growth of e - commerce . the online  gaming industry , in other words , appears to be booming , and it may be  an ideal time to is time to invest .  we decided to  find out who the key players were in the business . after speaking with  a number of industry insiders , the trail led us to an emerging ,  publicly traded company called gaming transactions inc . ( ggts ) . after a  close look at ggts , we decided that this company could produce huge returns on investment in the upcoming months .  although  ggts is a new company , it has some surprisingly experienced players at  the helm an uncommon thing to find in an industry only ten years old .  the company has come out with online versions of the addictive game keno .  and its management team was smart enough to secure the rights to the  keno . com website , which , if youre marketing keno , is as good as it  gets . keno has the widest spread for the house of any mainstream  gambling game . ggts is also about to launch a suite of other online  gambling games , including poker and sports - book betting . once it offers  these popular games , and given that it already has keno . com online , the  company could bring in great revenues , attracting a lot of attention in  the investment community and driving up its stock price .  after a successful north american launch ,  gaming transactions inc . ( gtts ) has translated its games into chinese  and is about to hit asia . this initiative looks like a wise business  decision : many analysis anticipate that china will be the biggest  source of online gambling revenue by 2007 , so the company could be poised for massive expansion in terms of both profits and global reach .  what  does all this tell us ? a brand new company , a popular , well - known game ,  one of the biggest spreads for the house , a growing market , experienced  management , and a stock price that is trading under a dollar it adds up to the potential for huge gains for early investors . if youre interested in more information on the market and gaming transactions inc . , click here to read a free ten - page report . . .  to join market movers mailings http : / / ggtsstock . com to find out more .  first source data inc .  4535 west sahara ave # 217  las vegas nevada 89102  disclosure and disclaimer  investment news indepth reports ( hereinafter inir ) , operated by first  source data , inc .

"Subject: a cry for help  dear friend , i am mrs . sese - seko widow of late president mobutu  sese - seko of zaire ? now known as democratic republic  of congo ( drc ) . i am moved to write you this letter ,  this was in confidence considering my and situation .  i escaped along with my husband and two of our sons  george kongolo and basher out of democratic republic of  congo ( drc ) to abidjan , cote d ' ivoire where my family  and i settled , while we later moved to settled in  morroco where my husband later died of cancer  disease . however due to this situation we decided to  changed most of my husband ' s billions of dollars  deposited in swiss bank and other countries into other  forms of money coded for safe purpose because the new  head of state of ( dr ) mr laurent kabila has made  arrangement with the swiss government and other  european countries to freeze all my late husband ' s  treasures deposited in some european countries . hence  my children and i decided laying low in africa to  study the situation till when things gets better ,  like now that president kabila is dead and the son  taking over ( joseph kabila ) . one of my late husband ' s  chateaux in southern france was confiscated by the  french government , and as such i had to change my  identity so that my investment will not be traced and  confiscated . i have deposited the sum eighteen million  united state dollars ( us $ 18 , 000 , 000 , 00 . ) with a  security company , for safekeeping . the funds are  security coded to prevent them from  knowing the content . what i want you to do is to  indicate your interest that you will assist us by receiving the money on our  behalf . acknowledge this message , so that i can introduce you to my son  ( kongolo ) who has the out modalities for the claim of the said funds . i  want you to assist in investing this money , but i will not want my identity  revealed . i will also want to buy properties and stock in multi - national  companies and to engage in other safe and  non - speculative investments . may i at this point  emphasise the high level of confidentiality , which  this business demands , and hope you will not betray  the trust and confidence , which i repose in you . in  conclusion , if you want to assist us , my son shall  put you in the picture of the business , tell you  where the funds are currently being maintained and  also discuss other modalities including remunerationfor your services .  for this reason kindly furnish us your contact  information , that is your personal telephone and fax  number for confidential purpose . best regards , mrs m . sese seko",1

"Subject: a better investment than the stock market .  all our mailings are sent complying to the proposed h . r . 3113 unsolicited  commercial electronic mail act of 2000 . please see the bottom of this  message for further information and removal instructions .  parents of 15 - year old - find $ 71 , 000 cash hidden in  his closet !  does this headline look familiar ? of course it does . you most likely have  just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program ( usa ) .  and reported elsewhere in the world ( including my neck of the woods -  new zealand ) . his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when  she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried  beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15 - year - old  sons closet . nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when  she opened the bag and found it was full of cash . five - dollar bills , twenties ,  fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber - banded in labelled piles .  "" my first thought was that he had robbed a bank "" , says the 41 - year - old  woman , "" there was over $ 71 , 000 dollars in that bag - - that ' s more than my  husband earns in a year "" .  the woman immediately called her husband at the car - dealership where  he worked to tell him what she had discovered . he came home right away  and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up . little did  they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than  actually finding it in the closet .  as it turns out , the boy had been sending out , via e - mail , a type of  "" report "" to e - mail addresses that he obtained off the internet . everyday  after school for the past 2 months , he had been doing this right on his  computer in his bedroom .  "" i just got the e - mail one day and i figured what the heck , i put my name  on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out "" , says the clever  15 - year - old .  the e - mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one  $ 5 dollar bill to each person on the list , then delete the address at the top  and move the others addresses down , and finally to add your name to  the top of the list .  the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand  dollars in five - dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your  name at the top of the 5 - address list . "" i get junk e - mail all the time , and  really did not think it was going to work "" , the boy continues .  within the first few days of sending out the e - mail , the post office box  that his parents had gotten him for his video - game magazine subscriptions  began to fill up with not magazines , but envelopes containing $ 5 bills .  "" about a week later i rode [ my bike ] down to the post office and my box  had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it . there was also a  yellow slip that said i had to go up to the [ post office ] counter . i thought i  was in trouble or something ( laughs ) "" . he goes on , "" i went up to the  counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me . i had to ride back  home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all "" . over  the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the e - mail . "" the  money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the  closet , barely had time for my homework "" . he had also been riding his bike  to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $ 5 bills for twenties ,  fifties and hundreds .  "" i didn ' t want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks  with like five thousand at a time in my backpack . i would usually tell the  lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the  money ] and he was outside waiting for me . one time the lady gave me a  really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me  and my dad would have to come in and do it , but i just rode to the next  bank down the street ( laughs ) . "" surprisingly , the boy did not have any  reason to be afraid . the reporting news  team examined and investigated the so - called "" chain - letter "" the boy was  sending out and found that it was not a chain - letter at all . in fact , it was  completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws , title 18 ,  section 1302 and 1341 , or title 18 , section 3005 in the us code , also in  the code of federal regulations , volume 16 , sections 255 and 436 , which  state a product or service must be exchanged for money received .  every five - dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read ,  "" please send me report number xyx "" . this simple note made the letter  legal because he was exchanging a service ( a report on how - to ) for a  five - dollar fee .  [ this is the end of the media release . if you would like to understand how  the system works and get your $ 71 , 000 - please continue reading . what  appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net -  you can use it too - just follow the simple instructions ] .  be financially free like others within a year ! ! ! before you  say "" bull "" , please read the following . this is the letter you have been  hearing about on the news lately . due to the popularity of this letter on the  internet , a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire  show to the investigation of this program described below , to see if it really  can make people money . the show also investigated whether or not the  program was legal . their findings proved once and for all that there are  "" absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if  people can follow the simple instructions , they are bound to make some  megabucks with only $ 25 out of pocket cost "" .  due to the recent increase of popularity & respect this  program has attained , it is currently working better  than ever .  note * follow the directons below , i had best results the second time when  i hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions .  in order for all of us to be successful , many , many emails must be sent so  that the returns are many . i have been extremely successful using the  following company . they send out the offers , and all i do is accept money  for reports , then i send back to the people as soon as possible .  this is what one had to say : "" thanks to this profitable opportunity . i was  approached many times before but each time i passed on it . i am so glad i  finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal  effort and money required . to my astonishment , i received total  $ 610 , 470 . 00 in 21 weeks , with money still coming in "" .  pam hedland , fort lee , new jersey .  here is another testimonial : "" this program has been around for a long time  but i never believed in it . but one day when i received this again in the  mail i decided to gamble my $ 25 on it . i followed the simple instructions  and walaa . . . . . 3 weeks later the money started to come in . first month i  only made $ 240 . 00 but the next 2 months after that i made a total of  $ 290 , 000 . 00 . so far , in the past 8 months by re - entering the program , i  have made over $ 710 , 000 . 00 and i am playing it again . the key to  success in this program is to follow the simple steps and not change  anything .

 remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people  ordering out of 5 , 000 you mailed to . dare to think for a moment  what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4 th of those people  mailed 100 , 000 e - mails each or more ? there are over 150 million people on  the internet worldwide and counting . believe me , many people will do just  that , and more !  method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet  advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of  free places to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will  easily get a larger response .  we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as  you go along . for every $ 5 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the  report they ordered . that ' s it . always provide same day service on all  orders . this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out with your name  and address on it , will be prompt because they can not advertise until they  receive the report .  = order each report by its number & name only . notes : always  send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not  accepted . make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2  sheets of paper or aluminum foil . on one of those sheets of paper , write  the number & the name of the report you are ordering , your e - mail  address and your name and postal address .  place your order for these reports now :  report # 1 : the insider ' s guide to advertising for free on the net  order report # 1 from :  r . r .  po box 18048  chicago , il 60618  report # 2 : the insider ' s guide to sending bulk e - mail on the net  order report # 2 from :  gm boland  353 jonestown rd . suite 125  winston salem , nc 27104  report # 3 : secret to multilevel marketing on the net  order report # 3 from :  r . chernick  po box 771661  c . s . florida 33077  report # 4 : how to become a millionaire utilizing mlm & the net  order report # 4 from :  m . eiseman  po box 451971  sunrise , florida 33345 - 1971  report # 5 : how to send out one million emails for free  order report # 5 from :  l . samon  po box 31  castletown  isle of man  im 99 5 xp  $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ your success guidelines $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $  follow these guidelines to guarantee your success :  + + + if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks ,  continue sending e - mails until you do . = orders , 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for  report # 2 . if you did not , continue advertising or sending e - mails until  you do .  + + + once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can  relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will  continue to roll in !

"Subject: wall street ' s dirty little secret . . .  it was the spring of 1979 .  i was just a tall , goofy looking kid in middle school  with buck - teeth and freckles . each day in the  cafeteria , i walked from table to table . . .  stealing other kids ' lunch money .  no , i didn ' t rob them with a gun or a knife - i just made  them a little deal . "" let me borrow two dollars today , "" i said ,  "" and i ' ll bring you five dollars next week . "" the investment  was too good to pass up , and other kids were throwing their  lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes . of course  when "" next week "" rolled around and i couldn ' t pony up the cash ,  i promised to pay them even more the week after that ,  if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit  longer .  eventually the end of the year came and went , high school  started and with it came girls , and homework , and parties ,  and sports , and those poor kids from eighth grade had more  things on their mind than last year ' s lunch money .  i made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid ,  and i didn ' t even get beat up .  hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market  secrets you will ever learn .  first of all , greed is your number one enemy . you ' re not  going to turn $ 2 into $ 5 in a week , so cash out when  you ' re ahead . don ' t wait for the boat to sink before  grabbing the lifejacket .  second , never trust an investment adviser of any kind .  they are looking out for their own money , not yours .  the "" professionals "" , those stuffy investment counselors and  money managers , will always tell you that the best time to  buy is now . according to those guys , the longer you keep  your money in the market , the more money you ' re going to make .  ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is  "" never "" .  in a sense , they are right . if you put $ 250 , 000 in an index  fund right now , you ' ll probably have over a million dollars  in thirty or forty years . but here ' s the problem :  do you want to wait thirty or forty years to be rich ?  hell no !  you want the money now - so you can enjoy it . it ' s hard to  make use of your fortune when you ' re seventy years old  in a wheelchair . if you could make a million dollars in  the next few years , what would you do with it ? where would  you travel ? what kind of car would you buy ?  the fact is . . . youth is the best time to be rich .  if your goal is to make quick profits in the market , volatility  is your ally , and stability your enemy . you want to see  those large upswings , two hundred points in a day , followed  by the four hundred point crash a week later . you don ' t  care if the market went up or down 20 % this year as long  it was unstable . that ' s how you ' re going to make the  money .  what i ' m talking about here is day trading .  my father invests the traditional way ; he holds some good stocks  and he goes up 30 k and down 30 k . in the long term of 5 - 10 years  he makes money .  the day trader buys or sells 5 , 000 shares of xyz for a  $ 25 , 000 profit in a 5 - 10 minute trade . he acts quickly , taking  advantage of all the information at his disposal about a  certain stock , and estimating whether it will go up or  down within hours , sometimes within minutes .  i can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing  amounts of money at it . it ' s not rocket science , and you  only need to learn a few basic principles to get started .  society would have you believe that successful trading is  complicated and requires formal training .  the truth is , wealthy people use very simple investment  strategies to make money .  popular media and investment professionals portray successful  trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing  ring . they don ' t want the competetion - and they sure as hell  don ' t want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm  to execute a trade for which they ' d charge you forty or fifty  dollars .  they make their money only if you believe two lies :  1 ) that investing is too difficult and risky for the average  person .  2 ) that using an investment adviser who charges a high  commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks  per trade .  here is what the financial gurus in today ' s society absolutely ,  positively do not want you to know . . .  the strategies for profitable day trading are in fact  so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend  a few hours of studying .  after reading over 200 financial books and publications  during the past decade , and after using day trading  to successfully make more than four million dollars in  the stock market , i ' ve learned the following lessons :  * * achieving financial success is incredibly simple .  * * anyone can do it .  * * it only takes a few hours to learn .  when i discovered the secret to day trading , i didn ' t become  wealthy overnight . if you want instant cash , drive to wal - mart .  buy a ski mask and a shotgun , and rob your local bank . the  only way to get rich , quick or otherwise , is through  hard work , knowledge , and determination .  after learning the fundamentals of day trading , i started  practicing the trading art itself , and the first few weeks  brought modest gains . the next few months gave me the practical  experience i needed to really earn a living , and i was pulling  close to a six figure income . in less than three years with no  formal financial training , minimal effort and only moderate risk ,  i had made my first million . the knowledge that i gained  during those formative trading years i am willing to share  with you in my new book , the master trader . you will learn from  my mistakes , and from my successes , as i teach you the simple ,  secret formula for day trading that i ' ve used profitably  year after year .  the income of the day trader can be staggering . thousands , even  hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within  minutes . the difference between making money and losing your  shirt is simply this : knowledge . i will provide that knowledge ,  and i will give you a winning edge at this high - stakes game .  average income of a day trader :  5 % average an income in excess of $ 500 , 000 per year  22 % average an income in excess of $ 250 , 000 per year  35 % average an income in excess of $ 100 , 000 per year .  27 % average an income between $ 50 , 000 and $ 99 , 999 per year  11 % average an income between $ 20 , 000 and $ 49 , 999 per year  after reading the master trader , you will discover extremely  profitable , simple yet powerful trading methods that give  you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you  win despite the current market weakness .  here is just a snippet of what i will teach you :  * * * make money whether a stock goes up or down .  * * * learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds .  * * * learn exactly what stocks to trade , the exact price to  buy them and the exact price to sell them .  * * * save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the  mistakes beginners make .  * * * learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money  consistently in every market !  * * * learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance  for great success .  * * * profit on huge intraday price swings .  * * * make money on the biggest news stories .  * * * actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum  returns .  * * * learn how to use the tools and information wall street  professionals use .  * * * learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind .  it ' s time to ask yourself : "" am i going to listen to the  professionals who say buy buy buy but never sell ? or am  i going to take control of my own financial future , and  start making money right now in the stock market ? ""  who is looking out for your best economic interests - some  wealthy wall street stockbroker , or yourself ?  with the master trader e - book , you will learn everything you  need to know in order to get started with day trading . . . from  choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the  lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional  trading strategies that make professional traders millions of  dollars .  the master trader e - book is the most comprehensive yet easy to  understand and straight - forward book ever written about active  trading . if you are serious about success in short term stock  trading - order today and start paving the road to your  own financial future .  oh , and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade ?  his high school friends laughed when he said he was going to  make money in the stock market .  six years later , he bought a beach - front home on the california  coast - with cash . oops , they weren ' t laughing anymore .  in a rollercoaster market like we have today , day trading  is the fastest track to wealth . if you ' re looking  for a long - term retirement investment with no risk  that goes up 5 % a year , then by all means , this ain ' t  your kind of game .  but if you want the quickest possible way to make a fortune  in the market , with the lowest element of risk , then  order the master trader e - book right now . i promise  to teach you all of the secrets that helped me become a  millionaire through successful day trading .  you don ' t need to know anything about the market , and  anyone can do it , with minimum effort . it ' s an easy  game to win if you know how the pieces move .  order the master trader e - book right now for only $ 49 . 97  by clicking on the link below :  http : / / 4 tools 4 life . com / qs  our company is strictly opposed to unsolicited emails .  to be removed from this list , please send an email  to "" bulkexpert @ yahoo . com "" ",1

"" that ' s why i ' m sitting up  here and you are all sitting out there ! ""  with network marketing you have two sources of income . direct  commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from  sales made by people you introduce to the business .  residual income is the secret of the wealthy . it means investing  time and money once , and getting paid again and again and again .  in network marketing , it also means getting paid for the work of  others .  the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my  fingers . fortunately , sometime later i reread everything and gave  some thought and study to it .  my name is jonathan rourke . two years ago , the corporation i  worked at for the past twelve years down - sized and my position  was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to  open my own business . over the past year , i incurred many  unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and  creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my  business and i just couldn ' t seem to make ends meet . i had to  refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and  struggling business . at that moment something significant happened  in my life and i am writing to share that experience in hopes that  this will change your life forever financially ! ! !  in mid december , i received this program via e - mail . six month ' s  prior to receiving this program , i had been sending away for  information on various business opportunities . all of the programs  i received , in my opinion were not cost effective . they were  either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial  investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work  or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one  year . it didn ' t tell me i ' d have to write a book to make it !  but like i was saying , in december i received this program . i  didn ' t send for it , or ask for it ; they just got my name off a  mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! !  after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it  correctly , i couldn ' t believe my eyes .  here was a money making phenomenon .  i could invest as much as i wanted to start without putting me  further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it  out , i would at least get my money back . but like most of you i  was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal  aspects of it all . so i checked it out with the u . s . post office  ( 1 - 800 - 725 - 2161 24 hrs ) and they confirmed that it is indeed  legal ! after determining the program was legal and not a chain  letter , i decided "" why not . ""  initially i sent out 10 , 000 e - mails . it cost me about $ 15 for my  time on - line . the great thing about e - mail is that i don ' t need  any money for printing to send out the program , and because all of  my orders are filled via e - mail , the only expense is my time . i am  telling you like it is . i hope it doesn ' t turn you off , but i  promised myself that i would not ' rip - off "" anyone , no matter how  much money it cost me .  here is the basic version of what you need to do :  your first goal is to receive at least 20 orders for report # 1  within 2 weeks of your first program going out . if you don ' t , send  out more programs until you do .  your second goal is to receive at least 150 + orders for report # 2  within 4 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do .  once you have your 150 orders , relax , you ' ve met your goal . you  will make $ 50 , 000 + but keep at it ! if you don ' t get 150 right off ,  keep at it ! it may take some time for your down line to build .  keep at it , stay focused , and do not let yourself get distracted .  in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report  # 1 . i kept at it - kept mailing out the program and by january 13 ,  1 had received 26 orders for report # 1 . my first step in making  $ 50 , 000 in 90 days was done .  by january 30 , 1 had received 196 orders for report # 2 ; 46 more  than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 1 , of my  e - mailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every  day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car .  please take time to read the attached program , it will change your  life forever ! ! remember , it won ' t work if you don ' t try it . this  program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the  rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it  won ' t work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money !  in order for this program to work very fast , try to meet your goal  of 20 + orders for report # 1 , and 150 + orders for report # 2 and you  will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 90 days . if you don ' t reach the first  two goals with in four weeks , relax , you will still make a ton of  money , it may take a few months or so longer . but keep mailing out  the programs and stay focused ! that ' s the key . i am living proof  that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program ,  i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or  risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and  you will be on your way to financial security .  if you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble  like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this  a sign . i did ! - sincerely , jonathan rourke  p . s . do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look  like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome !  a personal note from the originator of this program :  by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you  should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal ,  could not have been created by an amateur .  let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business  for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was  doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but  it wasn ' t working .  finally , i figured it out . it wasn ' t me ; it was the economy .  inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had  been with us since 1945 .  i don ' t have to tell you what happened to the unemployment  rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there  were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before .  the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were  doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not including  those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down  into the ranks of the poor .  as the saying goes , ' the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . ""  the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to  "" move up "" or "" get rich "" . inflation will see to that .  you have just received information that can give you financial  freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a  little bit of effort .

"" please read this program carefully . this  is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making  opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all  multilevel businesses , we - build our business by recruiting new  partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows  you to recruit new multilevel business partners , and we offer a  product for every dollar sent . your orders come by mail and are  filled by e - mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you  do it privately in your own home , store , or office .  this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere :  this is what you must do .  1 . order all 5 reports shown on the list below ( you can ' t sell  them if you don ' t have them ) .  * for each report , send $ 5 . 00 cash , the name & number of the  report you are ordering , your e - mail address , and your name &  return address ( in case of a problem ) .  * make sure your return address is on your envelope - in case of  any mail problems !  * when you place your order , make sure you order each of the five  reports . you need all five reports so that you can save them on  your computer and resell them .  * within a few days you will receive , via e - mail , each of the five  reports . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for  you to send to the 1 , 000 ' s of people who will order them from you .  2 . important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed  next to each report , or their order  on the list in any way other than as instructed below in steps "" a ""  through ' g "" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits .  once you understand the way this works you ' ll also see how it  doesn ' t work if you change it . remember , this method has been  tested , and if you alter it , it will not work .  a . look below for the listing of available reports .  b . after you ' ve ordered the . five reports , take this advertisement  and remove the name and address under report # 5 . this person has  made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $ 50 , 000 !  c . move the name and address under report # 4 down to report # 5 .  d . move the name and address under report # 3 down to report # 4 .  e . move the name and address under report # 2 down to report # 3  f . move the name and address under report # 1 down to report # 2 .  g . insert your name and address in the report # 1 position .  please make sure you copy every name and address accurately ! copy  and paste method works well , .  3 . take this entire letter , including the modified list of names ,  and save it to your computer . make no changes to the instruction  portion of this letter .  your cost to participate in this is practically nothing ( surely  you can afford $ 25 ) . you obviously already have an internet  connection and e - mail is free !  to assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the 5  reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing  information which includes how to send bulk e - mails , where to find  thousands of free classified ads and much , much more .  here are two primary methods of building your downline :  method # 1 : sending bulk e - mail  let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes ,  and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000  programs each . let ' s also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 %  response . using a good list , the response could be much better .  also , many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs  instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out  only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders  for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000  programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people  respond and order report # 2 .  those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the  0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000  send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 %  response to that is i 0 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that amounts to  10 , 000 each of $ 5 bills for you in cash money ! then think about  level five ! that ' s $ 500 , 000 alone !  your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000  + $ 500 , 000 for a total of $ 555 , 550 ! ! !  remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of the 2 , 000 people  you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program !  dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or half  sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many  people will do just that and more !  report # 2 will show you the best methods for bulk e - mailing , and  e - mail software .  method # 2 - placing free ads on the internet  1 . advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive , and there are  hundreds of free places to advertise . let ' s say you decide to  start small just to see how well it works . assume your goal is to  get only 10 people to participate on your first level . placing a  lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response .  also assume that everyone else in your organization gets only 10  downline members . follow this example to achieve the staggering  results below : lst level - your 10 members with $ 5 . . . . . . . $ 50  2 nd level - 10 members from those 10 ( $ 5 x 100 ) . . . . . . . $ 500  3 rd level - 10 members from those 100 ( $ 5 x 1 , 000 ) . . . . . . . $ 5 , 000  4 th level - 10 members from those 1 , 000 ( $ 5 x 10 k ) . . . . . . . $ 50 , 000  5 th level - 10 members from those 10 , 000 ( $ 5 x 100 k ) . . . . . . . $ 500 , 000  this totals - $ 555 , 550  remember friends , this assumes that the people who participate  only recruit 10 people each . think for a moment what would happen  if they got 20 people to participate ! most people get 100 ' s of  participants .  think about it ! for every $ 5 . 00 you receive , all you must do is  e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it ! always provide  same - day service on all orders ! this will guarantee that the  e - mail they send out with your name and address on it will be  prompt because they can ' t advertise until they receive the report !  available reports * * * order each report by number , and  name * * *  * always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not  accepted * - always send your order via first class mail - make  sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets  of paper ( so that the bill can ' t be seen against light ) on one of  those sheets of paper include :  ( a ) the number & name of the report you are ordering ,  ( b ) your e - mail address , and  ( c ) your name & postal address ( in case your e - mail provider  encounters problems ) .  place your order for these reports now :  report # 1 "" the insiders guide to advertizing for free on the  internet ""  order report # 1 from :  randy dillard  p . o . box 8  osprey , fl 34229  usa  report # 2 "" the insiders guide to sending bulk email on the  internet ""  order report # 2 from :  carla brown  p . o . box 39093  sarasota , fl 34238  usa  report # 3 "" the secrets to multilevel marketing on the internet ""  order report # 3 from :  glynn schmidt  p . o . box 19424  sarasota , fl 34276  usa  report # 4 ' how to become a millionaire utilizing the power of  multilevel marketing and the internet ""  order report # 4 from :  christin joy  cpo 2398  501 e . college avenue  wheaton , il 60187  usa  report # 5 "" how to send one million e - mails for free .

"Subject: urgent contact  from the desk of : dr tom eke .  e - mail : dr _ tomeke @ spinfinder . com  lagos - nigeria .  attn :  request for urgent business relationship .  it is with my profound dignity that i write you this  very important  and highly confidential letter . first , i must  solicit your strictest  confidentiality in this transaction . this is by  virtue of its nature  as being utterly confidential and "" top secret "" .  though i know that a  transaction of this magnitude will make any one  apprehensive and  worried , considering the fact that we have not met  each other before ,  but i am assuring you that all will be well at the  end of the day . we  have decided to contact you by email due to the  urgency of this  transaction , as we have been reliably informed that  it will take at  least a minimum of two to three weeks for a normal  post to reach you ,  so we decided it is best using the e - mail , which is  quicker and also  to enable us meet up with the second quater payment  for the year  2000 .  however , let me start by introducing myself properly  to you . i  am dr . tom eke , a director general in the department  of petroleum  resources ( d . p . r ) and i presently head the contract  award panel incharge  of contract awards and payment approvals . i came to  know of you in my search for a reliable and  reputable person to  handle a very confidential business transaction  which involves the  transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account  requiring  maximum confidence . i and my colleagues are top  officials of the  federal government contract award panel . our duties  include evaluation , vetting , approval for payment of  contract jobs  done for the d . p . r e . t . c . in order to commence this  business we  solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer  into your account  the said funds . the source of this funds is as  follows : in the second  quarter of 2001 this committee was mandated to  review and award  contracts to the tune of us $ 400 million us dollars  to a group of five  firms for the supply construction and installation  of oil pipe lines  in warri and port harcourt . during this process my  colleagues and i  decided and agreed among ourselves to deliberately  over - inflate the  total contract sum from us $ 400 million to us $ 431  million united  states dollars with the main intention of sharing  the remaining sum  of us $ 31 miilion amongst ourselves .  the federal government of nigeria has since the  second quater of  year 2001 approved the sum of us $ 431 million for us  as the contract sum ,  and the sum of us $ 400 million has also been paid to  the foreign companies  concerned as contract entitlements for the various  contracts done , but  since the companies are entiltled to us $ 400 million  dollars only , we are  now left with us $ 31 million dollars balance in the  account which we intend to  disburse amongst ourselves , but by virtue of our  positions as civil  servants and members of this panel , we cannot do  this by ourselves ,  as we are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau  ( civil service  laws ) from opening and / or operating foreign accounts  in our names  while still in government service , making it  impossible for us to  acquire the money in our names right now . i have  therefore , been  delegated as a matter of trust and urgency by my  colleagues in the  panel to look for an overseas partner into whose  account we would  transfer the sum of us $ 31 million . hence we are  writing you this  letter . my colleagues and i have agreed that if you  or your company  can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our  behalf , you or your  company will retain 20 % of the total amount ( us $ 31  million ) , while  70 % will be for us ( officials ) and the remaining 10 %  will be used in  offsetting all debts / expenses and taxes incurred  both local and  foreign in the cause of this transfer . needless to  say , the trust  reposed on you at this juncture is enormous . in  return we demand your  complete honesty and trust .  you must however note that this transaction will be  strictly based  on the following terms and conditions as we have  stated below ;  a ) our conviction of your transparent honesty and  diligence  b ) that you would treat this transaction with utmost  secrecy and confidentiality  c ) that you will not ask for more share or try to  sit on the funds once it is under  your custody , or any form of blackmail .  d ) that upon receipt of the funds you will release  the funds as instructed  by us after you have removed your share of 20 % from  the total amount .  please , note that this transaction is 100 % legal and  risk free and we hope to conclude  this transaction seven to fourteen bank working days  from the date  of receipt of the necessary requirements from you .  we are looking  forward to doing business with you and solicit your  total confidentiality  in this transaction . there is no cause for alarm . i  give you my word that you  are completely safe in doing business with us .  transactions like this  have been successfully carried out in the past by  most government  executives . here in my country there is great  economic and political  disarray and thus looting and corruption is rampant  and the order of  the day , thus explaining why you might have heard  stories of how  money is been taken out of nigeria , this is because  everyone is  making desperate attempts to secure his or her  future , so that when  we retire from active service we donot languish in  poverty . i will  explain more to you when i have heard from you .  please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using  the above e - mail address .  i will bring you into the complete picture of this  pending business  transaction when i have heard from you and also  receive your  confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me  fax to you all  necessary information you need to know about our  pending business  transaction . i will also send to you my private  telephone and fax  numbers where you can always reach me . your urgent  response will be  highly appreciated to enable us transfer the funds  under the second  quarter of the year 2002 . thank you and god bless .  yours faithfully ,  dr . tom eke .  n . b . please be informed that this business  transaction is 100 % legal  and completely free from drug money or money  laundering . this is a  complete legitimate business transaction .  - -",1

"Subject: the lure of the san  network world fusion focus : amy larsen decarlo  on storage in the enterprise  today ' s focus : the lure of the san  03 / 14 / 00  dear wincenty kaminski ,  today ' s focus : the lure of the san  by amy larsen decarlo  e - business is changing how businesses value information . information  has become a strategic asset that gives companies an edge over their  market rivals . companies use intelligence to identify new markets and  make contact with prospective customers . in this media - saturated era ,  information itself is packaged and sold as a product . this makes the  ability to supply users with fast access to stored information on a  continuous basis absolutely crucial .  companies are clearly coming to a crossroads in their storage  implementations . with estimates for internet storage capacity needs  doubling every three months , it professionals are hungry for a scalable  solution to help them consolidate control of stored information . they  often look to storage - area networks ( san ) as a better option to manage  their information storage systems than distributed models .  today , most organizations rely on a distributed storage model that uses  file servers to process i / o requests from end users and other  application servers . in this model , all requests for data go through  the file server that owns the attached storage disks , and only one file  server can tap data on a particular disk via a scsi bus .  this model has several shortcomings . first , the amount of data a  server can access is restricted to the number of disks supported by the  bus , which limits the capacity of a single file server . second , because  the server processes each i / o request , it risks becoming a bottleneck .  third , this server model carries some daunting availability limitations ,  because only one file server is allowed to access a set of disks . if  that file server or any of its scsi connections fails , then users and  other application servers lose access to the stored files .  this model carries other major disadvantages . distributed file servers  rely on the data transport network to run backup and recovery operations  which can eat up bandwidth and slow normal network transmissions to a  crawl . finally , this decentralized setup is difficult to manage from  both a logical and a physical perspective . file server based storage  systems are distributed throughout the enterprise , so it is often  difficult to assess current and future capacity needs . and because  these servers use a parallel cabling scheme to link the file server to  the disk array , they can also be cumbersome to set up and manage .  sans promise to mitigate the problems that plague conventional file  servers , largely through consolidation of control . these specialized  storage networks claim higher availability , faster performance ,  centralized management , and by their architecture , the capability to  remove bandwidth - intensive data backup and recovery operations from the  lan . this frees up the lan for normal data communications and ensures  smoother back - up operations .  using high - speed transports like fibre channel , sans offer a high -  performance network optimized for moving storage data . sans also make  way for new storage implementations like lan - free backup . and , because  fibre channel can support distances of up to 10 kilometers , san devices  can be widely distributed , but also centrally managed as one network .  yet , as was the case with lans in their younger years , sans are still  developing . vendors are still working out major product interoperability  issues , while companies deploying san technology struggle with how to  merge the very different worlds of storage and networks and manage both  together . ultimately the hope is that , like lans , sans will develop into  a mature and highly manageable solution that supplies substantial  benefits at lower costs .  given that storage deployment and ongoing support costs can total 10  times the acquisition price for the equipment , the consolidated  management capabilities of a san may deliver the biggest benefit to  business .  to contact amy larsen decarlo :  -

( richardson ' s statement and fpa section 202 ( c ) order is posted on doe ' s  web site at :  http : / / www . energy . gov / hqpress / releaseso 0 / decpr / pro 0309 . html )  2 . ferc ' s 12 / 15 / 00 final order to fix california wholesale markets  ( ferc ' s order can be viewed at  california supplies ordered by richardson  o richardson orders listed entities to supply excess power to california iso  o order is effective as soon as iso certifies shortage , but ends 12 / 21 / 00 ,  unless extended  o prices to be agreed to by supplier and iso , or ferc will set rate later  o fpa emergency power authority transferred to doe in 1977  as he said he would on december 13 , u . s . department of energy secretary bill  richardson found "" an emergency exists in california by reason of the shortage  of electric energy "" and issued an emergency order under section 202 ( c ) of  the federal power act ( fpa ) requiring listed generators and marketers to  provide any power in excess of the needs of their firm customers to the  california iso . in a statement , richardson said the threat to the  reliability of the california grid requires a long - term solution , but that in  the short - term power must keep flowing to the state to avert blackouts .  the 76 listed suppliers have 12 hours after the iso certifies to doe that it  has been unable to acquire adequate supplies in the market to begin providing  requested service to the iso . the iso must inform each supplier subject to  the order of the amount and type of energy or services required by 9 : 00 pm ,  eastern standard time , the day before the services are needed . the order  directs the iso to allocate , to the extent feasible , requested services among  subject entities in proportion to each supplier ' s available excess power .  the order is effective immediately and will terminate at 3 : 00 am , eastern  time , december 21 , 2000 , unless extended . to continue to obtain supplies  under this emergency authority , the iso must re - certify the shortage to doe  headquarters every 24 hours .  the terms of the provision of electric energy and other services by suppliers  to the iso "" are to be agreed to by the parties . "" if no agreement is reached ,  then under the fpa ' s emergency authority secretary richardson "" will  immediately prescribe the conditions of service and refer the rate issue to  the federal energy regulatory commission for a determination at a later date  by that agency in accordance with its standards and procedures , and will  prescribe by supplemental order such rates as it finds to be just and  reasonable . "" the authority of ferc to set rates for power supplied under  emergency order at just and reasonable levels where the parties themselves do  not agree to a rate is explicitly included in fpa section 202 ( c ) . the doe  organization act of 1997 transferred the emergency powers of this section  from ferc to doe .  the 76 entities identified in the order ' s attachment are all the entities  that have provided power to the iso over the last 30 days . those entities  are ordered "" to make arrangements to generate , deliver , interchange , and  transmit electric energy when , as , and in such amounts as may be requested by  the "" iso , "" acting as agent for and on behalf of scheduling coordinators . ""  [ source : doe secretary richardson ' s december 14 , 2000 statement and order ;  electric power daily , december 15 , 2000 ]  ferc de - federalizes california markets , adopts other structural  reforms  a summary of the december 15 order and commission discussion  at its special meeting today , ferc unanimously approved its eagerly awaited  final order reforming the california wholesale markets , adopting the major  outlines of its november 1 proposed order and sending back to california the  responsibility for addressing state - related matters , as discussed below . at  the same time , ferc deferred consideration of retroactive refund issues as  well as the imposition of region - wide price caps .  ferc reiterated the november 1 conclusions that under certain circumstances ,  california ratepayers were subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates  due to california ' s "" seriously flawed "" market structure and rules in  conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions throughout the west .  while all four commissioners supported the order as a consensus - based outcome  that appropriately balanced all competing interests , each commissioner  expressed reservations with particular aspects of the order . chairman  hoecker and comm . breathitt expressed the strongest endorsement , while comms .  hebert and massey laid out their positions where they believed the commission  had either "" over - reached "" or not gone far enough , just as they did on  november 1 , as discussed below .  highlights of key actions :  ( 1 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to eliminate , effective immediately ,  the state ' s mandatory requirement that the state ' s investor - owned utilities  buy and sell electricity through the px , and allow these utilities to  purchase electricity through forward contracts and other alternative  mechanisms to manage supply risks . ferc terminated the px ' s rate schedules  effective at the close of business on april 30 , 2001 . in effect , as chairman  hoecker stated , the order de - federalizes 60 percent of the california  wholesale market established under the state ' s restructuring law , returning  ratemaking authority over company - owned generation to the california public  utilities commission ( cpuc ) .  ( 2 ) ferc modified the effective period of the november 1 $ 150 / mwh "" soft cap ""  proposal , limiting its application through april 2001 , whereupon a  "" comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which  incorporates appropriate thresholds , screen and mitigation measures "" must be  in place . in a related move , ferc ordered a technical conference early next  year to develop such a program by march 1 , 2001 , so that these measures can  be place by the may 1 , deadline .  in a major modification , ferc revised the refund conditions to clarify that  while certain refund conditions will continue to apply , unless ferc issues  written notification to the seller that its transaction is still under  review , refund potential on a transaction will close after 60 days .  as proposed , however , supply bids in excess of $ 150 will be prohibited from  setting the market - clearing price for all bidders and sellers bidding above  $ 150 / mwh will be required to report their bids to ferc on a confidential ,  weekly basis and provide certain cost support .  ( 3 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to require the establishment of  independent , non - stakeholder governing board for the iso . the iso governing  board must relinquish their decision - making power and operating control to  the iso management on january 29 , 2001 . a future order will set procedures  for discussion with state representatives on the board selection process .  ( 4 ) in a major modification , ferc adopted a $ 74 / mwh "" price benchmark "" for  assessing prices of five - year energy supply contracts . this benchmark will  be used in assessing any complaints regarding justness and reasonableness of  pricing long - term contracts .  to facilitate prompt negotiation of longer term power contracts at reasonable  rates , ferc announced that it will hold a settlement conference with market  participants .  ( 5 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to require market participants to  schedule 95 percent of their transactions in the day - ahead market and  instituting a penalty charge for under - scheduling ( in excess of five percent  of hourly load requirements ) , in order to discourage over - reliance on the  real - time spot market .  ( 6 ) ferc directed the iso and the three investor - owned utilities to file  generation interconnection standards .  ( 7 ) ferc affirmed the longer - term measures proposed in the november 1 order ,  including submission of a congestion management design proposal by april 2 ,  2001 .  ( 8 ) ferc deferred resolving key issues , including establishing new iso board  selection procedures , developing appropriate market monitoring measures and  negotiating protective orders associated with data collection .  ( 9 ) ferc reiterated its november 1 call to california policy makers there to  resolve state issues , such as : ( 1 ) immediately implementing the availability  of day ahead markets for power purchases ; ( 2 ) development of demand  responses ; ( 3 ) siting of generation and transmission ; and ( 4 ) assurance of  sufficient reserve requirements .  commissioner responses  comm . hebert reluctantly concurred , calling the final order a "" missed  opportunity "" to , among other things , send appropriate signals for new  generation siting and conservation . reiterating his november 1 concerns ,  hebert recounted the remedial remedies that he maintained the commission  should and should not have adopted . while expressing pleasure at the tone of  the order ( "" balanced and considerate "" ) , the bid certainly reversal , and the  role reserved for the state in the selection of the new iso board , hebert  nonetheless objected to the benchmark prices established in the order , which  he maintained appeared to be unreasonably low . hebert faulted the commission  for not attempting to reconcile the instant order with the november 8 order  approving the ca iso ' s emergency $ 250 / mwh "" soft cap "" proposal . hebert ended  by challenging the cpuc to do what it can to encourage utilities there to  forward contract , including easing the existing prudence review requirements .  comm . breathitt endorsed the order , reiterating her support for progress  towards open and competitive markets . she noted that the order properly  "" walked the line "" by taking all of the competing interests into account ,  calling it less than ideal , but a step in the right direction . she also  concentrated her remarks on the importance of creating stability which will  be accomplished by encouraging long term contracts and the implementation of  the $ 150 / mwh breakpoint . additionally she mentioned that any price below the  $ 74 / mwh benchmark will be presumed just and reasonable .  comm . massey concurred , but prefaced his remarks by expressing sympathy for  california ratepayers , stating that he felt that market power had been  exercised , that prices were not just and reasonable and that the marketers  had profited too much at the expense of others in the market . he warned  that , as he understood the legal precedents , the federal courts were poised  to grant cost recovery relief to the retailers which would then be passed on  to consumers . on the positive side , he approved of the de - federalization of  60 % of the market and the creation of long term contracts . however , he  emphasized that california regulators must now take the responsibility of  creating more generation and transmission . in the long term , comm . massey  hoped that solutions could be reached starting with a technical conference  and that the market would have rules more like pjm .  finally , comm . massey articulated what he would have liked to have done  differently . he stated that he disagreed with the fact that there is not  enough evidence to show that market power existed and he pointed to the  on - going investigation . he also disagreed with the $ 150 / mwh breakpoint ,  preferring instead a hard price per generator . the commissioner said he  would have set the long term benchmark for only two years instead of five and  that he would have opened a section 206 investigation in the west . finally ,  he stated that he would have liked to address the issue of refunds .  chairman hoecker began his comments by saying that the commission was forced  to act and act quickly because the stakes are so high . he feels that it is  now time for the state regulators and markets to act . he noted that by  shrinking the cal px , the responsibility is now with the cpuc to fashion the  long term contracts and that hopefully we will exit this situation with the  least amount of damage to the utilities . in regards to suggestions for a  regional price cap , the chairman stated that this would not work due to the  fact that the commission has no jurisdiction over bonneville , wapa and the  public power producers and that there is no spot market in the northwest .  however , he did urge secretary richardson to convene a conference in order to  address regional issues . finally , in conceptually addressing the california  situation , the chairman stated that competition or "" deregulation "" did not  fail in california , but that there never was competition in california .",0
"Subject: alex tartakovski  as you may know , we are trying to schedule an interview for alex tartakovski  in houston this week . i am copying everyone involved because i wont be able  to coordinate this tomorrow . we just brought our new daughter home today and  my wife is yelling at me to get out of my office .  i just found out that thursday & friday are bad days for him , so wednesday is  the only day to do it this week . he would come down tuesday night and fly  out wednesday evening . it ' s probably easiest for him to arrange his flight ,  but he will need a hotel and transportation from the airport . i gave him  donna ' s phone number for help . i assume the hyatt would be best . his home  number is 215 - 702 - 3705 and during the day his cellular is 267 - 981 - 5425 .  by way of background , i plan to bring in 3 people from outside the company to  fill in some of the "" vacants "" in my group ' s org chart . the 3 areas of  specialization that are needed to execute the business plan are ( 1 )  coordination of origination , ( 2 ) deal pricing and underwriting , and ( 3 )  modeling and portfolio management . alex is the perfect person for # 3 . he  has the deepest knowledge of probability of anyone i know and is efficient at  building analysis models , which will be a big job in this business because  portfolio management needs to be redefined in real time due to the lumpiness  of insurance contracts and the lack of any historical methods for evaluating  these risks . development of pricing models will be a joint effort between  "" my "" group and the research dept because this will need to draw on the  expertise in research as well as being a realtime activity as new deals are  being structured . i want to encourage joint work between vasant / amitava  and alex because his background and expertise is compatible with research .  over the past 2 years , alex and i spent a lot of time developing new  electricity spot pricing methodology and this is one area where he excels . i  would expect that he would be a valuable resource in research as well , and so  i would like for him to be able to meet with vince is possible . ( this could  possibly be done when vince is in philadelphia next week if there is time -  ( ? ) ) depending on what work needs to be done in the future , i could see him  working both on pricing research and this specific business unit .  i have attached alex ' s resume . i assume he would be manager level , but i ' m  not sure of this .  this doesnt necessarily come across in the resume , but the skills that are  useful to us are :  probability / statistical model development  development of theoretical pricing methodology  excellent computer programming skills  database development and data analysis  he has the best understanding of the nerc reliability data format outside of  mike curley , the nerc data manager .  designed and wrote the code for the pricing model used by ace power products  for deal pricing and porfolio mgmt .  excellent understanding of options pricing methodology and its application to  hedging insurance portfolios .  if you want to get into superconductor trading , he can design the standards .  can beat me at atari battlezone ( as well as being able to navigate a real  tank through a minefield ) .  one objective of this meeting in houston is to make him feel comfortable with  the organization ( with which you did such a good job for me ) and to give him  confidence that he will be able to do state - of - the - art pricing research in  the most innovative company in the world . he is also interviewing for a job  in morgan stanley ' s equity dept .  we will also arrange a meeting with per in ny , but i would like to be in the  office for that , so we can do that next week .  please call me @ 610 - 996 - 2522 if there are any questions . i may not pick up  but i will reply to voicemail promptly . i ' m up 24 hours this week anyway .  thanks ,  - - dave",0

"Subject: revised : organizational changes  to : enron north america corp .  from : cliff baxter and kevin hannon  in july , as part of the enron north america ( ena ) reorganization , the  implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the  continued growth of ena including : 1 ) accelerate the development of our  people , 2 ) significantly expand our customer network and associated markets ,  and 3 ) accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups , both  within ena and across enron . consistent with these objectives and with the  corporate goal of fostering   b ) the downstream coverage / origination groups which focus on delivering a  broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers  including pulp and paper , chemicals , plastics , refined products , metals and  mining , heavy manufacturing , industrial gases , fertilizers , transportation ,  textiles and glass manufacturing the eastern and western u . s . midstream  coverage / origination groups which focus on energy , finance and industries .  downstream coverage / origination  as energy deregulation continues in north america , it is becoming clear that  the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both  ena and enron corp . further , it is clear that ena can significantly expand  its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial  solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of enron  corp . against this backdrop , the downstream coverage / origination function  will expand its product offering to include not only ena  , s existing energy  commodities , energy services , finance , assets and pulp and paper capabilities  but also ees  , s energy outsourcing capability and global fuel  , s chemicals ,  plastics and refined products risk management capability . these additional  capabilities will be offered in conjunction with ees and the global fuels  groups . given the size and importance of this enron initiative , greg piper  will be returning from portland to manage this business . under greg  , s  leadership , the downstream origination effort will be segmented into three  sub - groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering :  a ) pulp and paper  ) edward ondarza will continue to manage the coverage  activities in the pulp and paper business . this group will be responsible for  the provision of innovative  products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provision  of paper risk management products ;  b ) chemicals , plastics and refined products  ) we have asked jim ajello to  lead the coverage activities in this business . this group will be  responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the  chemicals and refined products industries ;  c ) non - integrated industrials  ) bruce garner , formerly leader of bankers  trust  , s global metals and mining group in london , has joined ena to lead the  coverage activities in this business . this group will be responsible for the  provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining ,  heavy manufacturing , industrial gases , fertilizers , transportation , textiles  and glass manufacturing industries .  midstream coverage / origination  a ) eastern coverage / origination  ) this group  , activities will focus on  energy , finance and power development solutions for electric and gas  utilities , municipals , co - ops and energy service companies in the eastern  interconnect . we have asked janet dietrich to assume the leadership of this  group ;  b ) western coverage / origination  ) this group  , s activities will focus on  energy , finance and power development solutions for electric and gas  utilities , municipals , co - ops and energy service companies in the wscc . they  will also continue to manage all qualified facilities ( qf ) restructuring  opportunities in the western u . s . we have asked chris calger to assume the  leadership of this coverage group . chris will relocate to portland from  calgary where he currently leads the canadian downstream origination efforts ;  c ) ipp merchant coverage / origination  ) this group  , s activities will focus on  the provision of structured energy , finance and asset solutions for the  emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio  , s of merchant  power generation either through development or acquisition . we have asked  mike miller to assume the leadership of this group . in addition , mike will  continue to manage the power development activities in the eastern  interconnect ;  d ) eastern qf restructuring  ) this group will focus on the qf restructuring  opportunities in the eastern interconnect including the existing  restructuring and re - capitalization of the east coast power assets . we have  asked dave duran to assume the leadership of this business . greg blair ,  formerly of enron asia  , s development group , doug clifford , formerly of  citizens power , and dick lydecker , formerly of cogen technology , will join  this newly formed business .  2 ) commercial transactions :  the commercial transactions group ( ctg ) , co - headed by ray bowen and jeff  donahue , was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of  transactions within ena  ) and thereby , improve ena  , s efficiency in executing  transactions and free - up the origination groups to increase their intensity  of client coverage . ctg consists of six primary functions : transaction  development , capital structuring and portfolio management , commodity  structuring and transportation , transactional support / accounting , technical  analysis and upstream asset management .  the transaction development group will be responsible for deal leadership ,  execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction  with the originator . the function will be divided into four teams , each of  which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups . this  dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link , better service  and greater accountability with the origination groups ; however , the ctg  resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to  the highest value transactions across the coverage functions :  a ) midstream transaction development will be dedicated to the eastern and  western coverage / origination groups . the senior members of this group  include billy lemmons , george mccormick , erin norris and russ porter . billy  lemmons joined enron in 1992 . most recently , he was the vice - president of  capital structuring and risk management for ees . russ porter joins us today  from dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power  origination .  b ) downstream transaction development will be dedicated to ena  , s industrial  origination efforts in pulp and paper , petrochemicals and refining ,  environmental energy , metals and mining and other industries as coverage is  established . the senior members of this team include rodney malcolm , jay  boudreaux , finley biggerstaff and chris helfrich . we anticipate announcing  two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks .  c ) generation transaction development will be dedicated to the ipp merchant  services and power plant development and qf restructuring groups . the senior  members of this team include thomas suffield , andy kelemen , kelly mahmoud and  john house . thomas suffield joined enron in 1996 . most recently , he was the  vice - president of origination for the latin american group in azurix . we  anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few  weeks .  d ) upstream transaction development will be dedicated to the producer  finance , coal and gas assets groups . the senior members of this team include  brad dunn , john curtin and chris hilgert . we hope to announce the addition  of at least one vp to this group prior to yearend .  ray bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the upstream and  downstream transaction development teams with jeff donahue having primary  responsibilities for the midstream and generation teams . andrea reed will  continue to head capital structuring and portfolio management : all junior  commercial resources within the transaction development teams will have dual  responsibilities to both their transaction development teams and to the  capital structuring group . the remaining four groups within ctg will remain  largely unchanged . in addition , the origination and the transaction  development teams and their respective origination groups will be located  together .  we believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverage  and industry knowledge in all ena  , s markets particularly in the industrial  markets . it will also provide a closer partnership and accountability between  the coverage / origination groups and the ctg groups .  please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in north  america by working with us to implement these changes .",0

"Subject: discount rates and risk capital  dear vince :  i spent a little bit longer putting together my initial thoughts on  determining discount rates than i originally anticipated . it is somewhat  surprising , but there really isn ' t much academic work that i am aware of  that addresses these issues .  very briefly ,  1 . i think we need to come up with a way to define the concept of risk  capital simultaneously with the appropriate discount rate .  2 . i think it is important to model enron ' s opportunity cost of capital and  how that changes over time . the liquidity of a project will affect its  value in a very significant way when the opportunity cost of capital  changes over time . there is also likely to be a relation between duration  and discount rates that depends on the factors generating enron ' s  opportunity cost of capital .  3 . i have vague ideas about possible simulations that may help us quantify  some of the issues that i have raised .  please take a look at the attached document . you might find this somewhat  confusing , so i will give you a call later in the week to discuss this .  please let me know when you will be free . i look forward to hearing from you .  regards ,  sheridan  - determining discount rates for risky projects . doc  sheridan titman  department of finance  college of business administration  university of texas  austin , texas 78712 - 1179  512 - 232 - 2787 ( phone )  512 - 471 - 5073 ( fax )  titman @ mail . utexas . edu",0

"Subject: organizational changes  we are making a number of significant organizational changes . these changes  are intended to accomplish four key objectives :  first , we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successful  business model developed over the last decade in north america and europe .  this model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built  around a relatively small strategic asset position .  second , we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting  relationships . particularly with joe sutton  , s departure , the ability to  directly manage the day - to - day activities of 15 independent business units  has become increasingly difficult .  third , we need to accomplish these changes without , in any way , compromising  the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or  hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower - yielding  asset positions .  and fourth , as always , we need to take advantage of the reorganization to  redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities .  enron wholesale services  today , we are forming enron wholesale services ( ews ) which will consolidate  our global wholesale businesses . the closer alignment of our wholesale  businesses will accomplish the following : ( 1 ) enhanced communication and  coordination across business units , ( 2 ) more rapid deployment of people to  higher valued opportunities , ( 3 ) more effective prioritization of  opportunities across the wholesale business , and ( 4 ) more rapid extension of  enron  , s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries and  markets .  enron wholesale services will include our current north american , european  ( including japan and australia ) , global markets , and industrial markets  operations , and will be expanded to include enron  , s net works business unit  as well as a new unit  ) enron global assets . in addition , enron  , s merchant  businesses outside of north america and europe will be integrated into this  new structure as described below .  mark frevert , currently chairman of each of our wholesale units , will assume  the role of chairman and ceo of enron wholesale services . greg whalley ,  currently chairman and ceo of enron net works , will join mark in the office  of the chairman as president and chief operating officer .  providing further impetus for these organizational changes , several of our  international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadership  positions :  rebecca mcdonald , currently ceo of enron apachi , will join ews as president  and ceo of enron global assets . enron global assets will have responsibility  for managing all of enron  , s existing energy asset portfolio outside of north  america and europe . joining rebecca in the office of the chairman as coo  will be jim hughes , currently coo of enron apachi . rebecca and jim will  report to the ews office of the chairman .  sanjay bhatnagar , currently ceo of enron india , has joined ebs as ceo for the  middle east and asia region . sanjay will be responsible for building our  broadband business in this region and the current ebs team in this region  will report to sanjay . in this role , sanjay will report to the ebs office of  the chairman . in addition , sanjay will continue to remain responsible for  enron  , s wholesale energy business in india and will transition this business  into enron global assets in the near future .  diomedes christodoulou , currently co -

"Subject: mg metals : additional areas to look at  dear lloyd & richard ,  i have been discussing with eric gadd about two particular areas of concern  that will affect the london research group . i believe there are a number of  issues to address to ensure that the integration goes smoothly from a risk  management and quantitative analysis perspective , and i have put together a  ( by no means exhaustive ) list : -  i ) seamless transfer of front and middle office systems from an exotic  options linking perspective ( e . g . their spreadsheets link to different option  pricing add - ins )  ii ) development of volatility curves and factor analysis to ensure that we  can capture metals risk in our var system ( we will require historical data  for this ) . i am sure bjorn will be looking to the research group to assist  in this matter .  iii ) ensure that mg staff on quant and risk side become familiar with our  methods and systems and vice versa  these tasks will involve a significant degree of cross - communication with  relevant contacts within mg metals , and so i look forward to starting on the  process as soon as possible - i hope to play a full part from a quantitative  research and risk management perspective to ensure that everything goes  smoothly in this exciting new development , so please do not hesitate to  involve me .  best regards ,  anjam ahmad  research  x 35383",0
"Subject: message from charles shen at williams  dear vince :  how are you ? thanks for coordinating an offer for me .  as i told stinson early this week , i understand that  it is a little bit tricky for enron in term of my  starting date . to be honest , i am very flexible  myself , it really depends on enron . if you want me to  start right now , then i would expect enron to  compensate for my this year ' s bonus . in this case , it  is not quite fair for enron , since now we are already  at the end of october .  another option is that we can work out an offer right  now , and i can start my new job right after i get my  bonus from williams , which should be in the very  beginning of february . this choice is perfectly fine  with me . actually it might be even a little better for  me since williams has had very good year this year .  vince , i just want to tell you that i am very  interested in your group , and very excited about this  opportunity . if you have any questions , please feel  free to call me at 918 - 409 - 4308 .  sincerely ,  charles  do you yahoo ! ?  yahoo ! messenger - talk while you surf ! it ' s free .  http : / / im . yahoo . com /",0

"Subject: alp proposal  carrie ,  i am sending you , as promised , the draft of my proposal . please , let me know  if it meets your requirements . i shall be glad to revise it and send you the  final version .  vince kaminski  * * * * * * * * * *  one of the most important trends in the energy industry during the last year  was proliferation of electronic , internet based , trading platforms for  wholesale markets and for retail operations . websites such as  www . houstonstreet . com and www . altranet . com provide facilities for matching  buyers and sellers . the website operated by enron corp . ( enrononline )  represents an alternative solution under which enron acts as a principal in  every transaction . on the retail ? side , many retail e - commerce companies  offering auctions , reverse auctions and platforms for creation of buyers  ,  clubs challenge incumbent utilities . the objective of this project is to  evaluate the impact of e - commerce ( both at the wholesale and retail levels )  on the energy industry . the study will start with comparative analysis of  different wholesale trading and retail e - commerce business models and  evaluation of their long - term viability . the next step will be assessment of  the impact of e - commerce on price dynamics , profit margins and the level of  competition in different energy markets . a separate section will be devoted  to analysis of reaction of companies and organizations affected by e - commerce  ( incumbent utilities , organized exchanges , energy brokers ) to the new  competitive threat , and different strategies they implement to meet the  challenge . organized exchanges have accelerated in many cases the transition  to screen - based trading that has been already replacing open outcry  technology . power and natural gas marketers have created alliances ( with  other industry players , software companies and electronic exchanges ) to  create their own trading platforms . gas and electric utilities embarked on  development of vertical and horizontal e - commerce platforms , offering  services to households and other companies in the energy industry . the  critical question is how quickly different companies should react to the  competitive threats and how fast they should exploit opportunities created by  the internet based economy . it ' s quite obvious that the internet revolution  will change the energy industry ' s landscape during the next few years . the  objective of the project is to provide answers to the questions posed above ,  based on the currently available information . additionally , the participants  should come up with fallback strategies the energy companies should implement  in case the currently ? expected trends fail to materialize .   _",0

"Subject: re : generation earnings model  michelle ,  i agree with you that we need to run at least 500 iterations . but i did not  realize that it took 16 hours to run 100 iterations . helen and i talked  earlier about  using parallel computing technique to split the algorithm into smaller parts  and  run the parts separately on different processors , then aggregate the results .  this procedure makes better use of computer power and saves time . looks like  we have to do it this way now . buying a more powerful computer helps but  does not solve the problem .  in addition , we might want to re - consider if writing the code in vb is  optimal .  i was assured at the very beginning that vb runs as fast ( if not faster ) as c ,  but some re - assurance from it group on this issue is helpful .  best ,  alex  from : michelle d cisneros @ ect 04 / 09 / 2001 02 : 52 pm  to : alex huang / corp / enron @ enron  cc : gary hickerson , danielle romain  subject : generation earnings model  hi alex -  danielle and i were talking to david m . today regarding running the model for  purposes of back testing the results . last week we ran calpine using 46 days  of historical forward price data at 10 and 100 iterations . the 100 iteration  run took 16 hours to run . to run all 20 companies with the 46 days worth of  data and at 100 iterations is estimated to take about 28 days . we are  concerned that 100 iterations will not be sufficient and will need to be  increased to at least 500 iterations .  we are thinking that we need to use a server or something much more powerful  than the test computer we have been using . do you have any suggestions as to  how we can improve the process ?  thanks ,  michelle  x 35435  hi alex -  danielle and i were talking to david m . today regarding running the model for  purposes of back testing the results . last week we ran calpine using 46 days  of historical forward price data at 10 and 100 iterations . the 100 iteration  run took 16 hours to run . to run all 20 companies with the 46 days worth of  data and at 100 iterations is estimated to take about 28 days . we are  concerned that 100 iterations will not be sufficient and will need to be  increased to at least 500 iterations .  we are thinking that we need to use a server or something much more powerful  than the test computer we have been using . do you have any suggestions as to  how we can improve the process ?  thanks ,  michelle  x 35435",0

"Subject: re : short - sell vs exercise  chonawee ,  as i have pointed out , short - selling the stock may be a bad  decision because of tax implications ( ignoring the legal aspects ) .  suppose the strike is $ 70 and you were granted an atm option .  you sell short at $ 70 ten lots ( one lot = 100 shares ) . the price goes to  $ 100 .  you lose $ 30 x 1000 = $ 30 , 000 on your short position . option exercise  gives you $ 30 , 000 . this is before taxes . you pay taxes  on your option income ( it ' s treated as ordinary income ) . the tax is  28 % x $ 30 , 000 = $ 8 , 400 . you can use only $ 3 , 000 of your loss against  ordinary income . this saves you only $ 840 in taxes .  of course , if you have capital gains , you can use losses on your option  position  as an offset .  the remaining part of your capital loss is carried forward and you get the  tax benefits over time ( less the time value of money ) , assuming you have  income in the  future ( or capital gains ) .  not so good .  by the way , valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock options  is a very interesting and difficult problem .  vince  chonawee supatgiat @ enron  07 / 10 / 2000 11 : 40 am  to : stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect , vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : short - sell vs exercise  below is my writing that was originally planned to post somewhere . it  explains how to handle a special type of call options which can be exercised  but cannot be sold . ( as we know that it is never optimal to exercise a call  option before its maturity ) . however , after taking vince ' s comments on the  ordinary income / capital loss tax offsetting issue , i think this is not a good  article anymore . i guess i could just throw this article away . : - )  - chonawee  short - selling is better than exercising your employee stock options  in general , the sensible time to exercise your employee stock option is when  you speculate that ene is going down or its growth rate is extremely low . in  fact , when exercising the options , you are speculating that ene would never  reach this point ( plus interest ) again during the 10 years maturity date or  until you leave the company . if you do not anticipate that , you should hold  on to your options because you can gain higher profit by delaying your  exercise .  however , if you believe that ene is reaching its peak . then , instead of  exercising the options , you should short - sell ( or sell ) the stocks in that  amount . after short - selling , when you feel that the stock starts to go up ,  you can buy them back ( to cover ) , make profit , and still keep the options . on  the other hand , if the stock does not go down as expect , you can exercise the  options to cover your short position anytime .  let us take a look at a simple case where there are no taxes , no dividends ,  and zero risk - free rate . suppose that ene follows a simple sample path as  follow  if you exercise 100 ene options with a grant price of 45 when ene reaches 70 ,  you would earn ( 70 - 45 ) * 100 = $ 2 , 500 . but if you short sell 100 ene at 70 , no  matter how much ene is in the future , you can exercise the options to cover  the short position and still earn ( 70 - 45 ) * 100 = $ 2 , 500 . the advantage of  short - selling comes when ene at the period 2 is 60 . at this point , you can  cover your short position , get ( 70 - 60 ) * 100 = $ 1 , 000 , and still keep your  options or you can exercise the options and gain $ 2 , 500 . that is , you still  keep the flexibility of your options when you short - sell . in conclusion , the  only sensible time to exercise your employee stock options is to cover your  short position .",0

"Subject: stephen bennett  stephen bennett , professional meteorologist , was hired into the research  group in september of this year as a specialist based on salary alignment  criteria . in retrospect , and upon review , he should have been hired on as a  senior specialist .  after coming on board . it rapidly became apparent that stephen was clearly an  "" under hire . "" he is well - deserving of an immediate promotion ( really more of  a correction ) and pay raise , to be made retroactive at least to the lst of  this month . this memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring  error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive "" promotion . ""  at the time of the interview process , there was no position in enron  designated as "" professional meteorologist . "" in fact , the most recent similar  hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist ,  who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while  functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job  classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional  professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the  proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original  uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist  category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected  at this time .  although a "" new - hire "" to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work  experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the  weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in  atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations ,  needing no further training and only minimal supervision .  once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron  values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed  responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager  level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather  briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation  as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly  briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a  master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through  other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous .  stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self - initiative . he  designed , implemented , and now maintains several sub - sites on the research  web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific : the weather  derivatives team , the agricultural team , and most recently , the crude and  liquids team . i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion  and major upgrade of this web page .  these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  , s regular  duties which include starting work at 5 am daily , reliably and without fail ,  to assemble and prepare our trader  , s weather report . recently , with the  advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline , stephen voluntarily  on his own accord , assists in our new sunday weather support effort . as his  supervisor , fully cognizant of his already standard 50 + hour work week , i do  not solicit , but readily accept , this above and beyond expectations  assistance .  in review , the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was  enron  , s immediate need for a non - standard , fairly unique professional - a  meteorologist , coupled with stephen  , s desire to work for our company in spite  of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional  title reflecting his chosen career path . . once hired , stephen has clearly  demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well - deserving  of this immediate and retroactive promotion .",0

"Subject: short term private firm model : static historical  snapshot + performance data for model development  mike , scott , eric ,  after brainstorming and discussing further on data here , we think that our  final specifications for modelling data requirement need to be as follows :  we need bankrupt , default and nondefault ( which covers nonbankrupt ) accounts  with 4 quarterly observation snapshots and 12 months performance following  the latest snapshot . monthly performance indicator need to be available for  the entire 12 months performance period . we will need all the bankrupt and  default accounts and comparable sample of good accounts with weights .  for the purpose of model validation , we will need data with above specs  covering 16 months of performance . this means that we will need rolling ( 4  quarterly snapshots + 12 months performance ) data for 4 monthly shifts :  input snapshots performance  1999 march end , 1999 june end , 1999 september end , 1999 december end 12  month end performance for jan 2000 through dec 2000  1999 feb end , 1999 may end , 1999 august end , 1999 november end 12 month  end performance for dec 1999 through nov 2000  1999 jan end , 1999 apr end , 1999 july end , 1999 october end 12 month end  performance for nov 1999 through oct 2000  1998 december end , 1999 mar end , 1999 june end , 1999 september end 12  month end performance for oct 1999 through sep 2000  we will need bankruptcy chapterwise indicator , if available during the  performance period . our definition of default is either bankruptcy or 90 +  days delinquency on any trade credit .  we have also discussed the cost aspect and we think considering the big  picture , it makes sense to spend the extra amount to get the right data for  analysis .  please let me know your thoughts . this will require d & b to give us a  modified quote and we could possibly move forward quickly .  regards ,  amitava",0

"Subject: fund raising for mit sloan school  dear vince ,  please find the following description of the program that i would like to  raise additional funding for . i will follow up today with a phone call to  answer any questions you may have .  as always we appreciate your time and support .  thanks ,  jozef  the eastern european students at mit sloan school of management are  preparing an eastern european week to be held in march 2001 . the one - week  long program will familiarize our classmates with many of the countries  that are going through the post communist transformation . as you well know ,  eastern europe has a great deal of opportunities for many companies .  unfortunately , it also presents many obstacles that make most of the  opportunities difficult to capture .  because we believe that we can help to eliminate some of these obstacles ,  we want to bring the eastern european experience to mit sloan school of  management . familiarizing the future business leaders with the countries  is only one step toward reforming eastern europe , but we believe it is  worth our time and effort .  during the week , we plan to bring series of lectures addressing the  business environment in eastern europe . we want to emphasize especially  the success stories from eastern europe . such companies as enron ,  volkswagen , exxonmobil , gm , and ge have entered the eastern european market  and show commitment to stay in it . in at least one panel discussion with  academic experts and industry participants we hope to let everyone know  that eastern europe is a real place for business .  in addition to the educational activities , we are preparing number of  cultural events that will introduce the culture of this area .  the scope of our program depends greatly on the funds we will be able to  raise from our sponsors . in return , we plan to advertise our sponsors in  every activity we will do . we will make banners and any other appropriate  advertising as desired by the sponsor . should a sponsor be willing to send  a speaker for the panel discussion or to give a speech / lecture we would  appreciate the enrichment to our program .  the advertising will reach nearly 700 sloan students and faculty . in  addition , the advertising will reach all newly admitted students , as they  will visit our campus for the admit day ( an official program to sell our  school to the admitted students ) .",0

( as of june  19 )  2 ) looking at copper position you calculate a var of - 3 , 100 , 568 with a  total outright of 63 . 765 mt .  this seams too low . if i calculate 63765 x 1807 x 3 . 99 % = 4 . 218 mil . us $ . var  ( outright qty x price levelx risk factor , riskfactr as per mercur ) .  in my view we have been understating var in mercur because we do not  consider the spread position correctly ( i . e . in detail ) . on a position like  that i would expect a figure of around 6 mil us $ .  i guess the issue is in the volatility and in the holding period .  3 ) your correlation matrix for the commodities is not final i assume as  many fields are blank .  lets talk tomorrow on the phone .  attached please find the position summary for the last week # 30 ( since june  19 ) as requested by kirstee .

mail . my phone number is ( 617 ) 492 - 9551 .  i graduated from princeton university in 1996 ( mathematics ) , and came  straight to mit for a  ph . d . in operations management at the sloan schoolof management . in my first  three years i took all the required coursework in mathematics ,  optimization , stochastic processes , etc . , as well as a number of courses in  psychology ( at mit and harvard ) . i am working with prof . gabriel bitran ,  and i am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operations . in  particular , i am interested in the interaction between customers and  companies ( hence the interest in psychology ) . the ( tentative ) title of my  phd thesis is "" pricing substitute products on the internet "" , and i am  sending you the summary which i sent to tom gros a few weeks ago that will  give you an idea of what this research is about .  thanks again , and i ' m looking forward to meeting you and your research  group next week .  paulo  pricing substitute products on the internet  objective :  to develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services sold  on  the internet .  motivation :  this research is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and  optimization  models are not appropriate for internet - related businesses . the technological  innovations associated with the internet brought about an overload of  information  which inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices .  furthermore ,  companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers can  have access to .  the problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issue  faced  by internet companies . consumers usually search for generic products ( e . g .  vcrs  or computers ) without knowing exactly what they will buy . companies can show  different products and different prices to each consumer . this type of  flexibility  was not available until the internet came about .  the problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet . the  methodology developed by this research should be transferable to a number of  other settings , such as pricing services . services are unique , and there are  many cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by a  given company . our model will help companies decide which services to offer  to which customers and how much to charge for these services .  research strategy :  our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two components  which can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies . these  components are choice models and optimization models .  choice models :  choice models describe how customers make choices . the management literature  draws on two main sources for these models : psychology and economics . the  common approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristic  elimination methods . these methods consist of the elimination of options  based on the sequential elimination of features until only one choice  remains .  these methods tend to be very context - specific and do not lend themselves very  easily to mathematical analysis . economists focus on utility - maximing models  that are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychological  models .  the most common economic model of choice is the logit model . the problem with  these types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of how  consumer make choices on the internet . the first step in our research will  be  to develop choice models that capture the interactions going on between  customers  and companies on the internet .  optimization :  traditionally , the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over a  certain planning horizon . on the internet , the problem of maximizing revenue  still exists , but there is also a need to learn about customers . short term  profit is based on sales , but long term profit is based on how well you know  your customers and are able to retain them . the optimization problem must  therefore include a short term component ( sales ) and a long term component  ( learning ) .",0

"Subject: california update 5 / 4 / 01  if you have any questions , please contact kristin walsh at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510 .  bridge loan financing bills may not meet their may 8 th deadline due to lack of support  sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance / bridge loan by the may 8 th deadline . any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart . according to sources , both the republicans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis . the democratic caucus is reportedly "" unwilling to fight "" for davis . many legislative republicans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that , once the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund , davis would "" double dip "" into the fund . clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor . however , it is believed once davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated , a bond issuance will take place . additionally , some generator sources have reported that some of the long - term power contracts ( as opposed to those still in development ) require that the bond issuance happen by july 1 , 2001 . if not , the state may be in breach of contract . sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may 8 th , having a bond issuance by july lst will be very difficult .  the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would "" eat "" the $ 5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general fund , thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $ 8 billion . however , the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession . sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor ' s plan for handling the crisis , including the details and terms of all long - term contracts he has negotiated , before they will support the bond issuance to go forward .  currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan ; ab 8 x and ab 31 x . ab 8 x authorizes the dwr to sell up to $ 10 billion in bonds . this bill passed the senate in march , but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support . ab 31 x deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts . however , sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen , currently in ab 8 x . senator bowen ' s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments ( which , if passed , would be likely to cause a socal bankruptcy ) .  according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature , republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund . for instance , tony strickland has stated that only 1 / 2 of the bonds ( or approximately $ 5 billion ) should be issued . other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds . the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday . additionally , lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan .  key points of the bridge financing  initial loan amount : $ 4 . 125 b  lenders : jp morgan $ 2 . 5 b  lehman brothers $ 1 . 0 b  bear stearns $ 625 m  tax exempt portion : of the $ 4 . 125 b ; $ 1 . 6 b is expected to be tax - exempt  projected interest rate : taxable rate 5 . 77 %  tax - exempt rate 4 . 77 %  current projected  blended ir : 5 . 38 %  maturity date : august 29 , 2001  for more details please contact me at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510  bill sb 6 x passed the senate yesterday , but little can be done at this time  the senate passed sb 6 x yesterday , which authorizes $ 5 billion to create the california consumer power and conservation authority . the $ 5 billion authorized under sb 6 x is not the same as the $ 5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased , or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward . again , the republicans are not in support of these authorizations . without the details of the long - term power contracts the governor has negotiated , the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support . no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb 6 x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power . also , there is no staff , defined purpose , etc . for the california public power and conservation authority . however , this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates , who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis .  socal edison and bankruptcy  at this point , two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy . the first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor . the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is august 15 th , however , some decision will likely be made earlier . according to sources , the state has yet to sign the mou with socal , though socal has signed it . the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass . if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou , socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy ( or its creditor - involuntary ) due to the lack operating cash .  the second likely triggering event , which is linked directly to the bond issuance , would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31 x ( bridge loan ) stating that the dwr would received 100 % of its payments from ratepayers , then the utilities would receive the residual amount . in other words , the state will get paid before the utilities . if this language is included and passed by the legislature , it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy . socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments .",0

"Subject: introduction  vince :  as way of introduction , i wanted to write a bit about mars inc . and then  about cds ,  the unit i head . mars is a private company , considered to be the largest  privately owned  manufacturing company in the world . mars is not in the habit of disclosing  its  finances ,  so the best i could do is refer to forbes ' estimate of $ 15 billion annual  revenue and  to the profit margins of similar companies between 5 - 12 % . mars is in the  business of  manufacturing confectionery ( m & m , dove bar , skittles , twix , - all ( r ) )  food ( uncle ben rice ( r ) ) pet food ( pedigree , whiskas waltham ( r ) ) and other  products .  mars has prospered during the years because of a unique philosophy that  emphasizes the  long term goals of the company . part of the philosophy is to look for win - win  solutions with  its suppliers , customers and partners .  as can be understood from the nature of the company , a large chunk of its  expenses  goes towards purchasing commodity like products , and hence the history of  researching  those commodities and the weather that influences their supply and the demand  ( people  eat less ice cream in the winter and less chocolate in the summer ) .  cds has a history of few decades in forecasting weather and has been very  successful ,  with an envious track record , in helping mars get a competitive advantage in  these arenas .  cds is a global group ( in 4 countries across two continents ) which supports  the  purchasing  function and the corporate at large in these and other arenas . it is a  multidiscipline and  multinational team with a lot to offer .  not having a ready access to the energy markets , and with a risk profile based  on  manufacturing expertise , mars has decided to look for potential partners in  this  area .  enron presence in the market place certainly makes it an interesting party to  talk to .  in talking to enron , we are careful to suggest that mars is not committing to  anything  at this point , and all we are after is to find out if there is an interest to  pursue the opportunity  we discussed in the future .  i am looking forward to our video conference call .  kind regards ,  avi  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  avi i . hauser phd mba  cds director  100 international drive mt olive nj 07828 - 1383  + 1 973 691 3664 ( office )  + 1 973 347 8189 ( fax )  + 1 973 727 3622 ( car + slow paging )  hauser @ cdsusa . com",0

"Subject: altos na gas model  kim , i know you have been interested in the development of a long term  natural gas model for use in the ets revenue management effort . i agree that  the ability to model various supply / demand scenarios for north america  should prove useful in ets business development efforts , and in particular ,  in predicting the impact of the new , large alaskan gas supplies on the n . a .  pipeline grid .  as you know , vince kaminski feels that a software product developed by dale  nesbitt ( marketpoint , inc . ) of los altos hills , ca . may be a good choice , and  one readily available in a relatively short time . marketpoint has proposed  that they work with us in our offices for a week of intensive training and  testing , so we can make a more informed decision before ordering the  software . they have proposed a charge of $ 12 , 000 , plus expenses , for the  one - week session , with that cost applied to the first year ' s subscription  price ( approx . $ 55 - 60 m / yr ) should we decide to go forward . the other  details ( timing , ene resources required , necessary it interface , etc ) still  need to be worked out , but i believe there is generally a consensus to  proceed with the test .  with my recent relocation to the clean fuels group , i will no longer be  responsible for the alaskan pipeline development . however , danny mccarty is  pulling together a team consisting of people from nng , nbp and elsewhere in  ets to push the project forward . i believe eric gadd will be playing a key  role as well . the decision on the long term gas model should appropriately  be made by the new project team .  i have attached a draft of the proposed marketpoint license agreement . it  has not yet been fully reviewed by legal ( or by shelley c . for the  "" affiliate "" issues ) .  let me know if i can provide any other background or assistance .  jng",0
